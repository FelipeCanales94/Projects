The Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is a course ran by Dr. Nils Napp at the University at Buffalo. This course teaches us the basics of artifical intelligence and is taught in the programming language Python. In this course, Dr. Napp gives us assignments with a couple of beginner functions that he implemented and we have to implement the rest of the program.
