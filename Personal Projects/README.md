Water Sort Puzzle Reinforcement Agent - Currently, I am addicted to a mobile app called "Get Color". In this game, you start off with an X amount of tubes and X-2 amount of colors. The colors are scattered amongst each tube with 2 tubes being empty. The goal of the game is to simply get each like-color in the same tube. Here, I simulated the app by creating a level using the GYM Library. I then created a Deep Q-Learning Model to solve the game. More additions such as stats/numerous levels will come.
